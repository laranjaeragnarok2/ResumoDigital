## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Indigo (#4B0082), echoing sophistication, technical expertise, and a nod to artistic depth. It balances technology and creativity. A dark color scheme is required.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), almost black, complements the dark indigo.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#70CBC0) to add contrast and highlight key interactive elements. Its analog hue adds a touch of creativity without overpowering the main palette.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for a modern, clean, and highly readable design.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace), is also used in VS Code, to align the home page with the 'tech' esthetic.
- Split the layout into horizontal and vertical scrolling sections. Code editor style for technical section, grid layout with descriptions and thumbnails for the art portfolio.
- Eye-catching transition effects to create a sense of technological sophistication while maintaining artistic flair when changing sections
